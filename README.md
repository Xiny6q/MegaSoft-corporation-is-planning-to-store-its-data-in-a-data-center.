MegaSoft corporation is planning to store its data in a data center.
[4 points] MegaSoft corporation is planning to store its data in a data center. It has two design choices: (a) install a regular desktop file system (like a Windows file system or Linux file system) on each server, or (b) install a cloud file system (such as HDFS or GFS) to store the data.

What are the advantages of choosing option b over option a? Please justify your answer

[2×2=4 points] Captain Kirk has installed an HDFS-based file system to store Starship Enterprise’s data. After a battle with Klingons, he found that the file system has been impacted. Will Kirk be able to get the data back in each case? If yes, then explain how. If no, then explain why Kirk can’t get the data back.

(a) The Klingon attack caused a datanode server hard drive to fail.

The Klingon attack corrupted a Namenode hard drive that caused the FsImage and EditLog to be unusable.
